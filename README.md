If you have a Delphi application using TClientDataSet for saving and reading CDS files and need to distribute DBClient.dll and Midas.dll files in Windows 11, you may need to manually merge registry keys since RegSvr32 does not handle these files effectively. Ensure you update the paths to all DLL files in the reg-file before merging it into your registry.
